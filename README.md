# A Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe Game with Minimax Algorithm

## Project Description

### Overview

The game is played on a 3\*3 grid. You have to choose a sign between 'x' and 'o', and players(you and computer) take turns to mark empty squares.
The first player to get 3 marks in a row(up, down, across or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. When all 9 squares are full and no player achieve the 3 marks in a row, call it a tie game.

### Technologies Used

1. Minimax Algorithm
   It is a basic algorithm usually applied in zero-sum game theory. The key logic is to minimizing the possibility to lose.
   The algorithm generates a tree data structure, and recursion is used in the structure to get the best result.

2. CSS animation
